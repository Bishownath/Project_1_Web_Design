We have used the linear gradient for the background image in all the pages which contrast the page heading and make it eye catchy. For the typography different level of heading has been used in the website upto h3. These things have been used generously to make the website look attractive to enhance user experience.

For the website accessibility, we have used the image alt tags in every images with its respective description which enhances the web accessibility.

For the seo content we have used the meta tags for the keywords and also the meta tags for the description in the website by which I have listed some of the keywords that are used mostly by all the customers while searching for the drink in the web.
Secondly, we have also created something like a backlink type of thing but in our own website (as we are in localhost) in order to make the user engage in our website to increase the organic traffic.
